Explain the concept of RAG.,"['Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside its training data sources before generating a response.']","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines large language models with external knowledge bases to improve response accuracy and relevance. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained data, RAG first retrieves relevant documents or information from an authoritative source. This retrieved data is then used to guide or augment the language model’s output, ensuring the generated content is grounded in up-to-date and verified information. This approach enhances the model’s ability to provide precise answers, especially for specialized or evolving topics, by integrating external context dynamically during generation.",RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) optimizes LLM output by referencing an external knowledge base.,0.625,0.4385948816592166
